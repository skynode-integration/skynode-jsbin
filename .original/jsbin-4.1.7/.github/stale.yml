  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  recent activity. More importantly, jsbin has been undergoing a massive
  refactor by Remy, and a large number of issues have been resolved, but
  with the growing 600+ open issues, the Stalebot (me), has been brought in
  to try to manage the issues.

  Keep an eye on jsbin.com blog posts and the @js_bin twitter account for
  updates on the new version of jsbin ❤️

  It will be closed next week if no further activity occurs. Thank you
  for your contributions.
